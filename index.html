                    Process begins with knowledge and experimentation. Through a system of backlog, grooming and rapid prototyping we can start with ideas and develop working concepts in days. This way of working allows for continuous user testing and iteration in real-time.

                    Data is key to building the right trajectory. We define success by the use of emerging technologies, expert knowledge, and user analytics. We can build micro accelerators for each project, each team, each interaction to develop MVP’s and realize business outcomes in customer adoption minimal time frame. Agile design and development sprints help us to produce databases and feature backlogs while we work to build a fluid design language.

                    We can set scaled releases through the entire process to ensure product success. Each version allows for a different user set to interact with the product offering, giving us valuable insight to iterate off of. We can effectively test and build at the same time, giving us the tools to launch more deliberate and effective products.

                <p>Natural light is essential to the creative process and workspace is only as functional as the light that defines it. We create an environment that allows light and space to breathe life into our projects, into our teams. Areas of interaction are defined in a clear and concise way. All too often we get trapped in the idea of an open floor plan without effectively defining ways of working. It is essential to the workflow to understand how we work and to identify critical areas based on our processes. <span class="highlighted">Recognizing the vital asset of having individual work time as well as small and large team sessions can help us create the right environment for our teams.</span> We solve complex issues for the user daily; we must do the same for ourselves. By defining spaces where an individual can work uninterrupted, where teams of four or less can fine-tune ideas with a clear agenda, and where larger groups develop without restrictions, we help our teams create, ideate and innovate.

                <p>A transference of force, from space and culture to our team. Without the right environment are we genuinely giving all we can to our work? Without the right culture are we throttling our creative process? Each person, each choice, each environment, each aspect of our culture either helps to bring energy into our workflow or takes from it. <span class="highlighted-2">Even in times of great challenge, we can find a way to harness our collective energy and move it on to the next idea or project.</span> I believe in fueling positive interactions, no matter how challenging. The outcome might not always be the way we want it to be, but we can take away something for the next project.

                <p>Hanford Washington in the Columbia River Valley is home to a nuclear waste graveyard. A graveyard that’s cleanup is 40 years behind schedule, with containment systems 20 years past expiration, and a three-year hard deadline on removal. The swift cleanup of this site is critical for the humans and nature within the surrounding area. My team developed a solution for cleanup management that harnessed the capabilities of the sites contamination sensors in unison with data from weather stations to create a warning system for onsite. The solution allows crews to relocate to safety when weather systems push hazardous material in their path. Previously, the company’s system would require a full evacuate upon contamination sensor deployment, a process that costs $1.3 million per evacuation. Our solution, allows crews to predict when and where contamination will occur, giving them the flexibility to move positions and outof harms way instead of fully evacuating.
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlighted-3">Our solution will save the company, government, and taxpayers an estimated $200 million every five years and can be migrated for use to the 107 other nuclear</span> waste sites around the country saving each the same amount.
