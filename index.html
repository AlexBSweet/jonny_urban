        Natural light is essential to the creative process and workspace is only as functional as the lightthat defines it. We createan environment that allows light and space to breathe life into our projects, into our teams. Areas of interaction are defined in a clear and concise way. All too often we get trapped in the idea of an open floor plan without effectively defining ways of working. It is essential to the workflow to understand how we work and to identify critical areas based on our processes. Recognizing the vital asset of having individual work time as well as small and large team sessions can help us create the right environment for our teams. We solve complex issues for the user daily; we must do the same for ourselves. By defining spaces where an individual can work uninterrupted, where teams of four or less can fine-tune ideas with a clear agenda, and where larger groups develop without restrictions, we help our teams create, ideate and innovate.
